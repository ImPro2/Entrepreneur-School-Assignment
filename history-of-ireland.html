                The economic history of Ireland begins at the end of the ice age when the first humans arrived. Agriculture then came about 4500 BC. Iron technology came to the Celts around 350 BC. From the 12th century to the 1970s, most Irish exports went to England.
                During this period food was the most important export of Ireland. In the 20th century,
                Ireland's economy has diversified and grown.
                The first settlers in Ireland were seafarers who largely survived by fishing. The Irish economy went on like this for about 3,500 years - until 4,500 BC when farming and pottery were used more widespread. Various animals and grain were imported from Europe. Wheat and barley were the main crops grown.
                Around 2500 BC there was an economic collapse and metalworking began then as well, with bronze being the most important metal at the time. Swords, axes, daggers, battle ax, halberd, eel, drinking utensils and horn-shaped trumpets were in the period 2500 BC to 700 BC, which was the Bronze Age.
                Mining also beganin 2500 BC, which 370 tons of copper were found. Only later were iron technology brought to Ireland (by the Celts). Kingdoms were also established.
                Around the 1200s, Normans invaded Ireland and forced the economy to focus on substitence farming  (potatoes and oats) and the south coast was focusing on fishing.
                The biggest of changes during the 1800s was infastructual improvements and a couple of canals (Grand Canal, Ulster canal, and the Royal Canal, to name a few). Also, the trade between England and Ireland was a very important branch of English foreign trade. Landlords who were absent had about eight hundred thousand pounds in farm rent by the turn of the century, up to one million pounds.
